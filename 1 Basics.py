Good to know

    The most recent major version of Python is
    Python 3.9, which we shall be using in this
    tutorial. However,
    Python 2, although not being updated with
    anything other than security updates,
    is still quite popular.
    In this tutorial Python will be written in
    a text editor. It is possible to write Python
    in an Integrated Development Environment,
    such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse
    which are particularly useful when managing
    larger collections of Python files.
